  Put here something interesting...
</p-->

I am Doctoral Student in Psychology and Psycholinguistics in the
[University of Kaiserslautern]. My research interest is on the
processing of a type of structure typically referred to as _Compound Nouns_
or _Nominal Compounds_. While a lot of the existing research has been carried
out in English, this structure is also present in several other languages,
many of which follow different patterns. Theories that explain how such
compounds are processed should also be capable of predicting the behavior of
speakers of these languages. Therefore, my interest is not limited to
English.

I am additionally interested on the theoretical implications to the current
models of human Working Memory that could arise from the relations I might
find between the processing of nominal compounds and individual Working
Memory abilities.

Finally, Machine Learning has been some sort of a side interest, resulting
from my background in Computer Science. In the area, my focus is on Deep
Neural Networks, and I have used most of the currently mainstream Machine
Learning libraries to develop my projects.

My Curriculum Vitae is available

Finally, I also like to write poems and songs. Check out the buttons in the
side bar for a list of my "artistic production" :-)
